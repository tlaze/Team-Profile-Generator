  ## Description

  After finishing a long project with your team it's nice to see who contributed. This application generates cards of employee descriptions to display who worked on a given project. Once the user runs the command, they will be prompted with a series of questions. As they go through the prompts the user will be asked whether the employee's title is a manager, engineer, or intern. Different questions will be asked depending on the user's choice. This application uses classes to form the blueprint of each employee. Once all the questions are answered, an HTML file will generate and allow the user to access the webpage to see an organized structure of the members of the given project.
